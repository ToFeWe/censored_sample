                You did not answer the comprehension questions correctly and did not participate in the main part of the study. <b>You will be paid a fixed reward of <u>{{ Constants.base_pay }}</u> and not receive a completion bonus for this study.</b>

                You are eligable for the bonus payment. After the end of the entire study, one out every thirty subjects will be randomly selected to receive an additional bonus.
                If you are selected for payment, your additional bonus will be determined as follows:
            </p>
            <p>
                The computer will randomly select one choice list for payout, with equal probability. We then
                randomly select one of your decisions from this choice list (with equal probability), and this
                decision will be implemented for real payment.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>If you won the bonus, we will inform you in the next days using your Prolific-ID.</b>
