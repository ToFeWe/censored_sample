The actual price of a lottery is set randomly. For this, a price will be chosen randomly.
This randomly chosen price is between 0 and the maximum amount that the respective lottery can pay out.
If the price is lower than or equal to your willingness to pay, you play the lottery. Your payoff will
then be determined by a random draw from that lottery.
Otherwise, the randomly selected price will be your payoff.<br>
