<h5>Example 1:</h5>
The lottery pays exactly 50 coins with a probability of 40% and nothing otherwise. You state that you are willing to
pay a maximum of 20 coins to play the lottery. A random number between 0 and 50 is then drawn, which determines the
price of 15 coins. Since this price is lower than your willingness to pay, you play the lottery. A random draw from the
lottery determines your payoff.

<h5>Example 2:</h5>
The lottery pays exactly 0 coins with a probability of 20%, exactly 60 coins with 30% probability and exactly 70 coins
with 50% probability. You state that you are willing to pay a maximum of 30 coins to play the lottery. A random number
between 0 and 70 is then drawn, which determines the price of 35 coins. Since this price is higher than your maximum
price, you do not play the lottery. You will receive the price of 35 coins as a payoff.
