<h5> The Lotteries </h5>
<p>
    In this study, we will ask you about your perception of, and preferences toward, different lotteries.
    Each lottery offers the chance to win different monetary prizes. The probabilities of these prizes may differ.
    You can find an example below:
</p>
<p>
    <table class="table table-bordered" style="text-align: center">
        <thead>
            <tr class="table-primary" style="border-color: black">
                <th colspan="4">Lottery</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <th> Probability </th>
                <td> 40 % </td>
                <td> 30 % </td>
                <td> 30 % </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th> Payoff </th>
                <td> 20 coins </td>
                <td> 40 coins </td>
                <td> 60 coins </td>
            </tr>
        <tbody>
    </table>
</p>
<p>
    Here, the lottery pays either 20 coins with 40% probability or 40 coins with 30% probability or 60 coins with 30% probability.
    Importantly, a lottery always only pays out one of the amounts; that is, it pays <b>either</b> 20 coins <b>or</b> 40 coins <b>or</b> 60 coins.
</p>
<br>
<h5> The Decisions and Bonus Payment </h5>
<p>
    In total, you will see <b>{{Constants.n_lotteries}} lotteries</b>. For each lottery, we will ask you two questions.
    First, we will ask you <b>how often you think you would win the highest prize</b> of the lottery (i.e., 60 coins in the example above).
    After that, we will ask you for your <b>willingness to pay</b> for each lottery;
    that is, for the maximum amount of money you would pay to participate in this lottery.
</p>

<p>
    Please indicate your <b>true</b> willingness to pay for each lottery. A payment mechanism will determine your potential bonus
    payment based on your stated willingness to pay. <b>The payment mechanism is designed in a way that gives you an incentive
    to indicate your true willingness to pay.</b> If you are interested in the details, you can find a complete description of
    the payment mechanism at the bottom of the page.
</p>

<p>
    At the end of the experiment, the computer will randomly select one of the 5 lotteries for payment. 
    The computer will then determine, based on your stated willingness to pay, your potential bonus payment.
    One out of every 3 subjects will be randomly selected to receive this additional bonus.
</p>

<p>
    During the experiment, we use a fictitious currency called coins. 
    For the bonus payment coins will be converted into US-dollar at a rate of {{exchange_rate}} coins = 1 US-Dollar.
</p>
{% if player.treatment == "FULL_BEST" or player.treatment == "BEST"%}
<p>
    <b>Note:</b>

    Before each decision, we will show you five draws from the relevant lottery.
    These are the five draws with the highest payoff out of a total of 400 random draws.
